# TestScripts

This repository contains basic sample test scripts written in Java, to be run via Selenium WebDriver.

# Guide:

**BasicStringMethodsTestNG.java** - this set of tests was created to show junior QA testers how basic string methods work in Java automated tests. It's not meant to be a comprehensive website test, but rather a fun way to see what string methods do, and how you can use them to test various elements on a website.

**HomeURLS.java** - this TestNG suite was created to test links on my website homepage (wessilverstein.com).
